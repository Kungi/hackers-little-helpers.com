Everyone knows it: once in a while one ends up in a new system and has no idea how it is set up.

A tool to be used in this case is `lsblk`. Just type it and you'll know what you're up against.


~~~
	$ lsblk
	NAME       MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE  MOUNTPOINT
	sda          8:0    0  100G  0 disk
	├─sda1       8:2    0 699,5G  0 part  /boot
	├─sda2       8:2    0 699,5G  0 part
	│ └─vol    254:0    0 699,5G  0 lvm
	│   └─vol  252:0    0 699,5G  0 crypt /
	└─sda3       8:3    0   512M  0 part
	sdb          8:16   0 465,8G  0 disk
	sdc          8:32   0 238,5G  0 disk  /home
	├─sdc1       8:33   0   100M  0 part  /data
	└─sdc2       8:34   0 209,9G  0 part

Another extremely useful flag is the `lsblk -f`, but that you can try out for yourself. :)
