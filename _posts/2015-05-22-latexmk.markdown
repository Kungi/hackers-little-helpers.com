While writing my bachelor and master thesis in tex I often needed to compile my
LaTeX files more than once to get the crossreferences or table of contents right.

[Latexmk][] automates this quite well. It is a little Perl script which includes
support for LuaTex and XeTeX. It can also clean the latex folder from all `.aux`
and other files with the `-c` option.
