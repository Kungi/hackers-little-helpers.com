title: "ack und ag - searching source code the fast way"

We all had the following problem. There is some source code and one wants to find out where a special function is called, because one has to fix this function or wants to determine its impact.
The solution for that might be abusing `grep` with the recursive-flag, but that is sooooo meh.

The actual solution for that problem is using `ack`.
`ack` is a little perl script that basically does the same as grep. One of the interesting differences (but certainly not the only one) is: it goes recursively by default by, at the same time, omitting binary data and version-control-specific files (like everything below `.git/`).

And in case you find it slow: you are not the first one: just use `ag`, which provides the same functionality, but is implemented from scratch in C (to make things fast).

Searching source â€“ the fun way: ack (or ag, the silver searcher) at your service.
