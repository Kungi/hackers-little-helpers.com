# Why this blog? #

In 2007 I started a project called the [Commandline Tools Blog][ctb]. This silently faded into sleep
after some time. On our last NoName e.V. meeting we had a very interesting [Show your Tools][syt]
session and I was reminded of this past project.

We showed the tiny things that make our life with the magic machine easier every day. The things you
are surprised about when your friend does not know about them.

# What's it about? #

This blog is about one of these tiny things every week. It can be a new tool like for example ranger
or percol. A small tip to make your life easier.
