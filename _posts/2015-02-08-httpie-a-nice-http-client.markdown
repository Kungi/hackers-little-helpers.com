[HTTPie][] describes itself as a "user-friendly cURL replacement" and well delivers
on this promise. The commandline syntax is more easy to grasp than cURLs.

HTTPie properly highlights requests ind responses. See the following hello world style

A very comprehensive documentation can be found on the github page.
Here is another example on how to examine a PUT request to httpbin.org.
