Every now and again it happens that one has the need to store a large amount of data, be it for backup or getting a large amount of data etc.
And every now and again the question might come up "where the heck is my diskspace gone again!?"

This question can be answered: try `ncdu`!

It walks your filesystemtree and shows you which directory takes up how much space on your disk, including the possibility to browse the displayed filesystemtree to find out which subdirectory is the guilty one.

So in case you are in desperate need of space again or just wanting to tidy up: `ncdu` is your tool.
